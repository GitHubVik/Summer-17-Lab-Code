# Summer-17-Lab-Code


This is the GitHub for all of my work at the Neuromuscular Control and Robotics Lab at the University of Pittsburgh

My work pertains to the Baxter Robot, by Rethink Robotics, specifically getting it to imitate human movements for tele-operated control remotely - applications in industrial settings, as well as medical.

7-17-17 - So far, this repository deals with arduino and python, using the MyoWare Muscle Sensor, and the MPU 6050 Inertial Motion Unit.
